## Problem
The administrator of a homeowner's association needs a system to efficiently manage all the administration tasks of the association. This program must include functionalities to cover all administration needs, from the control of the residents' fee payments to the maintenance of the facilities and the communication between the administrator and the owners or tenants.

## Overview
In the management of homeowners' communities, an administrator is responsible for multiple tasks essential to the smooth running of the premises, such as managing monthly payments from residents, scheduling maintenance, resolving incidents and organizing events or meetings. A comprehensive management system would allow the manager to keep a clear and updated record of all these activities, improve communication with residents and optimize the use of condominium resources. This type of tool facilitates the manager's organization and contributes to maintaining resident satisfaction .

## Background
A condominium, in general terms, is a group of individual housing units that share common areas, such as gardens, parking lots and recreational areas. Each resident usually contributes a monthly fee to the maintenance and improvement of these common areas. Often, a manager is hired to manage these funds and ensure that the condominium is in good condition.

## The program is structured comprehensively to address condominium management, focusing on key components such as financial administration, maintenance, security, communication, regulations, and implementation planning, the financial management component ensures the condo’s economic stability through the preparation and tracking of a detailed annual budget, maintaining accounting records to control income and expenses, monthly collection of condo fees, and creating a reserve fund for emergencies and major repairs, the maintenance and repairs section focuses on preserving infrastructure and enhancing resident’s quality of life by developing a preventive and corrective maintenance plan for all facilities, selecting and supervising service providers (such as gardening, cleaning, and security), and implementing an incident reporting system for residents to report issues or malfunctions. In security, access control systems (cards, tags and vehicle controls) are implemented, security personnel are hired and surveillance cameras installed, and emergency plans and regular drills are developed. The communication and participation component includes organizing general assemblies and regular meetings to inform residents and facilitate decision making, along with distributing newsletters to communicate condo activities and updates. The regulations and norms section involves periodic review and updates of the horizontal property law regulations and internal condo rules, establishing mechanisms to ensure all residents comply with these rules, and creating a system of penalties for rule violations.
