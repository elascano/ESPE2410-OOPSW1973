Workshop: Project Management System

Problem
Currently, the flow of projects within the implementation to billing process within a telecommunications company presents deficiencies due to the use of a manual system for the generation of payments, which affects the accuracy, efficiency of the monitoring process or changes during the course of a project. This system must include an automated manager for saving data records, as well as the generation and monitoring of detailed reports of projects already invoiced or in the billing process in order to record past or future projects, as well as whether they are in the execution stages, awaiting billing, or billed and paid. In order to minimize problems related to the status of unpaid projects or late billing, which occur when using the manual billing process.

Overview
In the telecommunications field, there are several areas, but this project will focus on a project manager. The automation of project scheduling and the generation of comprehensive reports about one or more projects are vital for management and executives in the telecommunications company to make better decisions. In addition, these reports are useful for tracking the status of projects, from sending prototypes and budgets to the client, to invoicing and potential project follow-up.

Software development project management is a complex process that involves optimizing resources, ensuring customer satisfaction, and delivering high-quality products within established timeframes and budgets. To achieve this, it is essential to make accurate estimates, identify and resolve issues efficiently, as well as provide ongoing support for already delivered products.

During the execution of a project, various questions and challenges arise that must be proactively addressed. For example, how to ensure that initial estimates are realistic? What strategies can be implemented to manage changes in customer requirements? How to minimize the impact of code errors?

In today's business context, there are numerous tools and platforms that facilitate the management of projects and internal processes. These integrated systems allow organizations to control aspects such as finances, inventories, planning and project management, improving efficiency and decision making.
