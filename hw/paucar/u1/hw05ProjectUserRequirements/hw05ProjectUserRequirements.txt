Requirements
Introduction 
1.1 Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to detail the software project requirements for a project management system. To reflect the real needs, expectations and services; we have chosen to classify the requirements into functional, non-functional, developer requirements and those proposed by our clients and users. This document is addressed to the development team and the clients, with the purpose of negotiating, understanding and analyzing the features and functionalities that must be implemented to meet the expectations that exist on the project.

1.2 System Scope 
The system to be developed will be called “Mole” a project manager that will allow you to record in which stage of development a project is located, it also grants organizational support to the management of new and old contracts, grants users the possibility of extracting reports from the status of a project according to the period of time they want Review. Being on the web, its portability is assured, however, it will not have the launch powers of a large-scale project. It is not linked to other VCS’s, the interface is only for users with the capacity of administrators who control their projects, obtaining reports will be automated.

Document Overview 

General Description 
The project is based on a telecommunications services sales environment under the concept of contract projects. These have quotation, acceptance, modification, billing and monitoring processes, which must be organized under categories according to their process or project status and interconnected in a database, which will be modified under an administrator; These interconnections must be immediate within the web, these implementations must be under free software and assigned chronologically by dates.

2.1 Product Perspective 
	The product aims to improve the graphical interface, the storage system and the quality of the code due to the dependence on external storage software and web services.
